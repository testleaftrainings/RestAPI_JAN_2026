how to validate json key should be integers in postman script

To validate in a Postman script that a JSON key's value should be an integer, you can use JavaScript's built-in Number.isInteger() function within the "Tests" tab of your request 

Here is how you can set up the script:

1. Open the request you want to test in Postman.
2. Go to the Tests tab.
3. Add the following JavaScript code to check specific keys in your response body. 

Example Script

This script retrieves the JSON response, accesses a specific key (e.g., userId), and asserts that its value is an integer. 

// Parse the response body as JSON
const responseJson = pm.response.json();

// Define the keys you want to validate as integers
const keysToValidate = ['userId', 'postId', 'some_id_field'];

// Iterate over the keys and perform the validation
keysToValidate.forEach(key => {
    pm.test(`"${key}" key should have an integer value`, function () {
        // Check if the key exists and if its value is an integer
        pm.expect(responseJson).to.have.property(key, 'Key "${key}" is missing from the response.');
        pm.expect(Number.isInteger(responseJson[key]), `Value for "${key}" is not an integer.`).to.be.true;
    });
});

Explanation

-> pm.response.json(): Parses the incoming JSON response body so you can work with it as a JavaScript object 

-> keysToValidate: An array holds the names of all the keys you need to check.

-> Number.isInteger(responseJson[key]): This is the core of the validation. It returns true only if the value associated with the specified key is an actual integer

-> pm.expect(...).to.be.true: This is a Chai assertion (the assertion library used by Postman's test scripts) that ensures the result of Number.isInteger() is true, causing the test to fail if it is not. 

When you run your request, the tests will appear in the "Test Results" tab, indicating whether each key passed the integer validation.
