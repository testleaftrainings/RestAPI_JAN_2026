isa method in hamcrest matchers library in java

Yes, there is an isA method in the Hamcrest matchers library in Java. 

The isA(Class<T> type) method is a convenient shortcut for the more verbose is(instanceOf(SomeClass.class)). It creates a matcher that matches when the examined object is an instance of the specified type. 

Usage Example

To use isA, you would typically use a static import: 

import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat;
import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.isA;
// ...

You can then use it in an assertion like this:

// Assuming 'cheese' is an object of type Cheddar
assertThat(cheese, isA(Cheddar.class));


This is functionally equivalent to:

assertThat(cheese, is(instanceOf(Cheddar.class)));


Note on Deprecation
The is(Class<T> type) method was deprecated in favor of isA(Class<T> type) to avoid confusion with the is(T value) method, which is a shortcut for is(equalTo(x)). The isA method is the recommended way to test an object's type in current Hamcrest versions.
